## Git

Git  is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different computers).

## Linux

Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn’t function.

## Learn a Programming Language

DevOps promotes teamwork, communication, and continual improvement. As a result, DevOps engineers must master specialized programming and scripting languages in order to expedite enhanced product releases and deliver them more frequently.

This means that a skilled DevOps engineer must be fluent in numerous programming or scripting languages. Furthermore, the more coding languages you know, the better you'll be at optimizing procedures and efficiently constructing software.

We have opted for Python and Go as our preferred programming languages for this purpose.
